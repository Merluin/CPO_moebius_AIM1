#gew-legend-neutral
GEW legend (B) and responses to neutral facial expressions as a function of the Intensity (A)

#gew-emotions

#tab-info-models
Table with model formulas, names and fitting parameters

#bias-plot
Posterior distributions and 95\% HPDIs of the bias effect A) Bias posterior distributions as a function of the intensity condition. B) Posterior distributions of the intensity delta contrast (full - subtle)

#intensity-plot
Posterior distributions and 95\% HPDIs of the perceived intensity effect A) Perceived intensity posterior distributions as a function of the intensity condition. B) Posterior distribution of the intensity delta (full – subtle).

#freq-plot
GEW responses as a function of displayed Emotion and Facial Expression Intensity. Each participant’s response was classified according to the position on the GEW to assign a label. The order of the x-axis corresponds to the clockwise order of the GEW. The y-axis represents relative frequencies in each condition.
